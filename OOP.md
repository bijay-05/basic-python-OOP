# OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

#### Object-oriented programming is a programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behaviour. It has four main pillars:

### 1. Polymorphism
### 2. Inheritance
### 3. Abstraction
### 4. Encapsulation


### Polymorphism
#### It simply means many forms. This indicates that a same person can have different roles. In contrast to programming, one method can have various forms. In python `len()` method has different roles. If we pass a string, it returns the length of string and on passing a list, it returns the number of items on that list.


### Inheritance
#### We can see that cats have the same color, name , fur, etc but they are not the same cat. A tiger cat, taby, persian, etc all are cats. They come under the main class cat but have various properties of their own. Similarly, we can have one main class, with child classes as well. The child classes will all inherit methods and attributes of their parent class but may have methods and attributes of their own too!


### Abstraction
#### A smartphone can perform many tasks. It doesnot show you the internal processes of how it's actually performing all these tasks so, implementation is hidden. It displays the relevant attributes and hides unnecessary details.


### Encapsulation
#### A company can have several departments such as HR, IT, Marketing, etc. All these make up a company. We can use it to hide data and get more flexibility such as setting variables as write only or read only etc.
